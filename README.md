## Avatar

An avatar is a visual representation of a user or entity. Rich UI provides different kinds of avatars that can be used at various places. Here are some examples of how it'll look in your code. You can add css according to your design.

This is the default look of an Avatar.

There are some scenarios where you would want it as a profile picture, or similar to that.

## Badge

A badge is a visual indicator for numeric values such as tallies and scores. A badge is used for many reasons, i.e, for notifications on an icon, or as an online/offline indicator, in such cases it is preferable to use "icons with badge" functionality. Rich UI has more design for that.

This is the default look of a Badge.

A card is a block/box-sized design that shows important things. E.g, Cards with different prices of subscription, Sellable things on Amazon and Flipkart.
