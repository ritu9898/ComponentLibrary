  <h2>Typography</h2>
  <p>Typography is our system of fonts. Each font conveys the appropriate sentiment to assist our users through each stage of their journey.</p>

  <h3>Font Stack</h3>
  <p>We use sans serif fonts for most of our type in-product, the exception being when you want to display code then you should defer to monospace fonts.</p>
  <div class="font-stack">
    <p class="roboto">Roboto</p>
    <p class="segoe">Segoe UI</p>
    <p class="mplus">MPlus</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Brand</h4>
  <p>We use our custom font, Charlie Sans, for almost everything brand and marketing â€” from banner ads to billboards. It was designed to be incredibly versatile with lots of range in terms of tone and playfulness. It can be quirky and expressive when it needs to be, or neutral when the situation calls for something a bit more serious. On rare occasions, we also use native typography for selected elements.

    Charlie is available in two styles, Display and Text.</p>
